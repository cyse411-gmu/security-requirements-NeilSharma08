As a malicious actor,
I want to intercept the MQTT messages between victims and the crisis center,
So that I can spoof distress messages or reveal private user data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The attacker can identify and parse MQTT payloads from drones.
- The attacker can inject false messages into the network.

As a malicious actor,
I want to overload the drone communication network with fake messages,
So that legitimate distress calls are delayed or lost.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Network accepts repeated invalid messages.
- Drones are unable to distinguish valid from fake requests.

As a malicious actor,
I want to execute arbitrary code on a drone,
So that I can spoof repeated fake distress messages from fake sources, leading to more allocated funding due to greater perceived destruction.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A remote code execution vulnerability exists in a drone's MQTT implementation.
- The crisis management center cannot tell when a drone is compromised.
