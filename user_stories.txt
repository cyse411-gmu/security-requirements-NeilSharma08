As a disaster victim,
I want to send my location and status through the rescue app,
So that rescue teams can locate and assist me effectively.

As a rescue operator,
I want to view incoming distress signals on a map dashboard,
So that I can prioritize and coordinate rescue missions efficiently.

As a government official,
I want to recieve aggregated data during the course of the flood,
So that I can appropriately allocate funds to different areas.
