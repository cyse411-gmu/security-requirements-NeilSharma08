As a security engineer,
I want to encrypt MQTT messages sent between victims and drones,
So that attackers cannot eavesdrop or modify critical distress data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- All MQTT traffic is encrypted with TLS.
- Messages must be authenticated and validated at the receiver.

As a security engineer,
I want to rate-limit incoming MQTT connections from a single source,
So that flooding or denial-of-service attacks are mitigated.

Acceptance Criteria:
- System enforces rate limits per client identity/IP.
- Excess requests are dropped and logged for audit.

As a security engineer,
I want to ensure the integrity of the running processes on each drone,
So that attackers cannot execute malicious code on a drone and send hardcoded messages.

Acceptance Criteria:
- MQTT implementation on drones is well-regarded as secure, implying that it is free from buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- Proper permissions management to ensure lack of privilege escalation if MQTT implementation is compromised.
- Custom antivirus ensuring no MQTT messages are hardcoded but rather passed from the listener to the sender.
